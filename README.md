# `demo-kafka-streaming`

## Overview

`demo-kafka-streaming` is a Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate the use of Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming. This application serves as both a Kafka consumer and producer, illustrating key Kafka concepts such as consumer batching. Additionally, it provides a REST API for producing messages into Kafka topics, making it a versatile tool for understanding and experimenting with Kafka's capabilities.

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform capable of handling high-throughput, low-latency data feeds. It is designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka provides a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds, making it ideal for event-driven architectures, log aggregation, and real-time analytics.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Producer**: Sends records (messages) to Kafka topics.
- **Consumer**: Reads records from Kafka topics.
- **Topic**: A category or feed name to which records are sent.
- **Partition**: Each topic can have multiple partitions, allowing for parallel processing.
- **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.
- **Consumer Group**: A group of consumers that coordinate to consume data from topics.

## Application Functionality

The `demo-kafka-streaming` application includes the following key features:

### Kafka Producer

- **Message Production**: Send messages to Kafka topics using a REST API.
- **Batching**: Demonstrates how messages can be batched and sent to Kafka efficiently.

### Kafka Consumer

- **Message Consumption**: Reads messages from Kafka topics.
- **Batch Processing**: Illustrates consumer batching to handle multiple messages at once.

### REST API

The application exposes a REST API endpoint for producing messages into Kafka topics. This allows you to easily interact with the Kafka producer without needing to directly use Kafka's Java client.

**API Endpoint:**

- **POST /produce**
  - **Description**: Sends a message to the specified Kafka topic.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "topic": "input-topic",
      "message": "Hello, Kafka!"
    }
    ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or later
- Apache Kafka (either running locally or via a managed service)

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/demo-kafka-streaming.git
   cd demo-kafka-streaming
   ```

2. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Kafka Configuration**:
   - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your Kafka broker details if they differ from the default.

### Example Usage

1. **Send a Message**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/produce \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"topic": "my-topic", "message": "Hello, Kafka!"}'
   ```

2. **Consume Messages**:
   - The consumer will automatically start consuming messages from the configured Kafka topics and process them in batches.
